    "Looking through the discussion in your email, it sounds like you are defining bias in terms of reliability and performance in various contexts. However, the assignment was more in regard to bias as it relates to equity among groups. I think you can still make this work for your use case, though.  From this perspective, the bias in horror movies versus romantic comedies would need to be defined as bias among genres in movies. That is, “is a movie more likely to be rated as more positive because it is a romantic comedy, versus rated more negative if it is a horror genre movie?” I think that would make sense even though the groups are defined based upon bias from the movie description, rather than bias from gender, race, etc. \n",
