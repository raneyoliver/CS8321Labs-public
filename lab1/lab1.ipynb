    "For example, we are trying to answer if a romantic comedy is ranked as more positive or if a horror movie is ranked as more negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we utilize the dataset of IMDB reviews that are pre-labeled as positive or negative and contain movie genres.\n",
    "We will analyze the bias using the word embeddings of GloVe & ConceptNet. Each of these embeddings will be applied to the movie reviews to determine the overall sentiment of the review. \n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that a \"lesser\" embedding will perform more poorly in the face of a conflicting sentiment lexicon. By this, we expect that \"horror\" movies may have more \"negative\" ratings because of the \"negative\" words used in the reviews to describe the content of the movie, versus the overall context of the review as positive or negative. If the embedding is more narrow-focused, like Glove, it may produce results that bias towards romantic comedies as more positive, since the overall content of the review should have more \"positive\" words based on the content of the movie. However, we expect an embedding that has a wider knowledge graph focus, like ConceptNet, to remove this bias and focus solely on the review content."
