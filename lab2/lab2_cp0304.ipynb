    "## 1.0 Introduction & Dataset Overview\n",
    "#### Give an overview of the dataset you have chosen to use. What is the classification task. Is this multi-task? Explain. What is the feature data? Who collected the data? Why? When? Is the data multi-modal? What evaluation criteria will you be using and why? \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are performing classification on Movie Review text to associate the text of the review with an overall \"positivity\" rating of Positive, Neutral, or Negative. By reviewing the text as a whole instead of sets of words or phrases, we are evaluating a sequential text to classify it into a distinct category.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "The dataset we are using for this analysis comes from an IEEE Open Access repository at the following source: \n",
    "- Data Source: https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/imdb-movie-reviews-dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset compiles movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb),  https://www.imdb.com/, and contains 1 million reviews from 1150 movies spread across 17 genres. In this dataset is other metadata such as the IMDb rating and movie rating. The data was compiled by Pal, Barigidad, and Mustafi and utilized and presented as a paper at the 2020 International Conference on Computing, Communication, and Security (ICCCS). In their analysis, they used the content of the movie reviews to classify the genre of the movie through word tokenization and a keyword list specific to the genre, and from their results they created a \"Movie Recommender\" based on a genre input from a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a multi-modal dataset because it only contains textual data. We did not choose a multi-modal dataset, although there are other IMDb datasets that do contain multi-modal data, such as this one: https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01992, which contains images of the poster of the movie, in addition to the movie genre, rating, and other text. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Task\n",
    "We utilized this dataset in Lab 1 for this course, where we performed sentiment analysis on the movie reviews and compared that sentiment to the movie positivity rating. For this lab, we differentiate that approach by using neural networks with a word embedding vectorizer to train a model. The training will analyze the sequential text in the review and use the associated rating to learn how the overall sequence relates to the positivity with respect to the vectorization of the sequence. Once that association is learned, the model evaluates new review sequences to classify those to an appropriate rating using the same vectorization analysis approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset, the reviews are rated on a scale of 1-10. With our classifier, we will expect to get a similar scale, so that it is a multi-class classification task. We have considered whether to segment the results into generalized score categories of: Score < 3.5 -> \"Negative\" , - 3.5 < Score < 6.5 -> \"Neutral\" , - 6.5 < Score -> \"Positive\"\n",
    "However, we don't believe there is much utility in generalizing the results because it could mask the underlying performance of the models. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "We are considering a few aspects to evaluate throughout this analysis. First, we will evaluate the model as it is fitting by reviewing the performance of the accuracy and the loss on the training and test datasets so we can ensure the model is both converging and not overfitting. Further, we will consider the convergence time on each model to evaluate the model efficiency (with some allowance/forgiveness to the performance differences of the processors on each of our computers, since it is not guaranteed that the same computer is performing all of the evaluations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once each model completes training, we will then utilize the F-score statistical testing as a metric to compare the performance of the models. F-score is an analysis of variance approach (ANOVA) that determines the statistical difference of two or more populations in hypothesis testing by comparing their variances. To do this, we divide the population sample variance between the groups by the variance within the groups to generate the F-score. If the F-score exceeds a certain value, then the null hypothesis can be rejected because the null hypothesis assumes that the variances are equal. If the F-score does not exceed this value, we cannot reject the null hypothesis because the evidence does not provide the conclusion that there is significant differnce in the variance. Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-perform-an-f-test-in-python/\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of this analysis, our null hypothesis is that the use of a transformer model, such as BERT, to analyze review text sequences to predict the overall rating will provide a more accurate classification performance than that of a traditional multi-layer perceptron. Further, we hypothesize that fine tuning BERT for our specific model will show an improved performance over BERT in its unchanged, transferred state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we're ultimately performing a classification task, we should consider not only the accuracy of the predcition, but we should consider the precision & the recall of the classification. For this task, we should consider both False Positives and False Negatives, with the assumption that the rating provided is the true rating for the movie. From a False Positive perspective, if a review provides a rating that is high whereas the rating is low, then the perception of the film is inverted, and a person may expect a masterpiece and instead experience an unsatisfying film. This would be a similar case for the False Negatives, where a review that reads with a low rating but actually has a high rating could lead to a person not experiencing an entertaining movie. Because either of these would defeat the purpose of the model, we should evaluate both Precision, which measures the model performance with respect to False Positives, and Recall, which measures the False Negative rate of the model. Therefore, we will look at maximizing the overall F1 score, which provides a weighted performance of both Precision & Recall so that it takes into account the performance of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives. \n",
    "We implement this approach using the following source: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/45165/how-to-get-accuracy-f1-precision-and-recall-for-a-keras-model"

    "## 2.0 Transfer Learning Foundational Model\n",
    "#### Describe the foundational model that you will be using to transfer learn from. What tasks was this foundational model trained upon? Explain if the new task is within the same domain, across domains, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Foundational Model: BERT\n",
    "In this analysis, we will perform transfer learning with the Bidrectional Encoder Representation (BERT) model (source: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805). BERT was developed by Google for text sequences, and it provides an architecture that can be utilized for a variety of natural language processing tasks and is able to encode the context of statements in two directions, which ensures a greater understanding of the message in the text. BERT has a base version that includes 12 encoder layers with 12 heads per layer and 110M parameters, and it has a large version that includes 24 encoder layers with 16 heads per layer and 340M parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the original paper, BERT performs bidirectional encoding by using a masked language model that randomly masks tokens in the input to predict the original vocabulary based only on context. The BERT framework can be utilized in two steps: pre-training & fine-tuning, where the model is trained on unlabled data and then fine-tuned with labeled data from downstream tasks. In the paper, the WordPiece embeddings (30k tokens, referenced in BERT paper above) were used to provide the foundational tokenization. For the pre-training, BERT used the BooksCorpus and English Wikipedia, which have 800M and 2500M words, respectively (all referenced in BERT paper above). From Wikipedia, only the text passages were utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because BERT can be used for a variety of tasks and is text-based, we can say that it is within the same domain as the task we are performing. From its original paper, BERT was built for, among others, question-answering tasks, hypothesis-premise tasks, and sentiment analysis tasks. Our goal is effectively sentiment analysis, where we are evaluating the overall context of the review and to what extent a film was perceived as \"good\". \n",
    "\n",
    "### Fine-Tuning Approach\n",
    "One advantage of BERT is that it can be fine tuned for a given task. This fine-tuning is readily-available because BERT contains a self-attention mechanism that allows it to model many downstream tasks so that it can encode a concatenated text pair with bidirectional cross attention between two sentences. The fine-tuning tasks are relatively efficient processing-wise compared to the pre-training. One approach to performing this can be found in: https://classic.d2l.ai/chapter_natural-language-processing-applications/finetuning-bert.html.\n",

    "## 3.0 Splitting the Data \n",
    "#### Split the data into training and testing. Be sure to explain how you performed this operation and why you think it is reasonable to split this particular dataset this way. For multi-task datasets, be sure to explain if it is appropriate to stratify within each task. If the dataset is already split for you, explain how the split was achieved and how it is stratified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was compiled without regard to the distribution of the rating. In a plot below, we show that the data is heaviliy weighted towards positive reviews (with the majority ratings of 9 or 10). However, there is a substantial number of reviews for all cases. One question to ask is if it is important to maintain the distribution of the ratings, or if it is more important to provide a classifier that can perform equally well regardless of the rating. Because of the distribution, we have a few options for the data:\n",
    "1) Do no data augmentation & perform a random 80/20 split for Training & Test Data. From a positive perspective, this maintains all the data for evaluation, and the randomness should remove some bias in the results. Further, this is a straightforward splitting task. However, from a negative perspective, we expect bias in the results to remain and be pointed towards the positive entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Keep an equal number of entries for each rating (Rating of 2 was the lowest quantity). From a positive perspective, this is very significant statistically and should provide satisfactory data. From a negative perspective, we may lose data quality from the diversity of the text provided for different rating values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Perform stratified shuffling & splitting. From a positive perspective, this is an improvement of option 1) in that new, \"unexpected\" bias, is not introduced through a random sampling. From a negative perspective, it still hold the bias towards the positive entries. However, one could argue that this bias towards a positive rating should be considered a \"feature\" of the data and perhaps means we should re-evaluate our \"upper limit\" for a \"Neutral\" rating. \n",
    "\n",
    "We ultimately decided to go with 2) above, where we removed many entries to keep the dataset with an even distribution. We ended with 5000 samples for each of the 10 ratings, which we believe is still statistically significant for this analysis."

       "  718: 'this movie is as you might suspect given the many reviews which are before and after not quite what it appears to be and that is why whatever it looks or sounds like it is not what you get the confusing premise is that there is virtually no ability to balance the tables what does that mean this movie is not honest thats what it means the horrible opening scene has this young white male attempting as we are to quickly learn to virtually steal his mothers television set and sell it for a few bucks so he might buy drugs his mother has the television chained to the radiator so as not to lose touch with whatever reality the television represents but passes the key to of all people her son the drug addict who is threatening her from behind a locked door here the author establishes a relationship that is in a nutshell what he is trying to figure out though this young person her son is nothing but a liar and everyone associated with him share and provide impetus for his and there lying ways even unto the death of the other through lethal injection that lethal injection is a main lining shot of heroin which these characters are guilty of being part of which involves a loss of a limb as well as the death of the lie that they lived under however the other end of this film is the relationship of the television to this kids mother which as it turns out is made to appear to be selling drugs of another sort the weight reducing hysteria turns television and its programs into an accomplice to another kind of tragedy that involves the power of suggestion and the extremely cruel and aggressive nature of having influence over society by way of its programing and power as such the film continues to show such grossly unjust and even indecent characterizations that we are really forced to look elsewhere for the answer as to the reason why this would exist at all even if it is dishonest this film is championing getting your way and believing it is indeed your way even as you are about to die of a overdose of heroin the source then is not a reliable gauge as to value and contributes to the demise of society by providing a influence that is indecent it is one thing in this world that we live in to be taken advantage of but it is another to be forced into an idealogical state that does not provide anything else but that how can in all the world a system baring witness to undue influence unfair power over and a lie to boot be looked at as the source of anything but an inhuman aggregate with gang like assumptions it is not so smart to suggest that this film is providing the eclipse of life unto death even through its title requiem for a dream the dream it seams is dead however that may not be the worst thing because it hardly had a chance in this world of the power of suggestion and here we are touching upon reality and the effect it has had upon the human race if you get put off by this well this is what this picture is about it is symbolic of an intent to kill honesty it is also bears witness to a foreign power in the likes of the influence of the technology that bears malice for its victims and is of such a predatory nature as to be a threat to civilization and even world peace this discourse is not for the benefit of the writer nor does it provide an answer to anything but getting ones way which is why i cannot give the writer credit but can suggest that the influence written of got what it wanted credit for getting its way everything in its wake is lessened by such an accomplishment and even more so we are provided with a lie this film has all the earmarks of a spear aimed at the heart of the human race just so you will know with so much power you must be selling something i do not recommend this film outside of its political importance and that i believe you should be warned as well because it is a living breathing reality that made for this film and it is a living breathing reality that made it possible that is what this film did it provided an ability to know reality and if your wise enough you will be forewarned of its coming don t sell the sell short it means what it suggests and it intends to convince you that it means to get its way ',\n",

the pros br br 1 the name skyfall is a great name for a movie br br 2 the theme tune a great theme sung by adele that harks back to the shirley bassey classics of yesteryear br br 3 errr that s about it br br the cons br br there are far too many to mention them all but they all fall into the camps of either lazy film making poor script writing pathetic attempts to turn bond into a superman terminator jason bourne on steroids type of character or just ludicrous plot contrivances that serve no other purpose other than to set up another scene examples in no particular order br br 1 the stolen list of undercover agents it s the whole reason for the story and yet how it was stolen is never mentioned it also completely vanishes from the storyline half way through never to be mentioned again br br 2 bond crashing his motorbike into the bridge wall to be thrown onto the top of a train no chance in a million years that would ve worked why do it the other guy just climbed up and jumped vaguely believable but bond has to do a superman effort br br 3 bond getting shot through the shoulder with a depleted uranium round apart from a quick wince does it affect him at all of course not he can still climb fight punch hang on to things and adjust his cufflinks without batting an eyelid hmmmm yes very believable i m sure br br 4 the fall from the train the fact he survives a fall like that is hands down the most ridiculous thing in a bond movie since the invisible car a fall of half that height into water would kill you instantly oh and then bond goes off a waterfall too he must ve been cursing his bad luck that day it still would ve been a thrilling shot if the distance to fall was 30 feet but no the film makers have to ramp it up to terminator only surviving proportions br br 5 the totally unbelievable overall plan and hacking ability of da silva hacking to mi6 s heating system to blow up m s office riiiiight and he knew she d be out at the time just like he knew they d retreat to the underground bunker place just like he knew he d be taken straight there when he was captured just like he knew he d be put into to a ludicrous glass cell with no bed no toilet no facilities at all in a room with single trapdoor that was computer controlled and also the only door between the most secure place in england and the public london underground railway system just like he knew the exact times everything would happen right from being captured near china being taken to the new mi6 headquarters seeing m q and bond cracking the code him being able to escape and then being also stopped by bond in exactly the right spot and at the right time to blow a hole in the underground tunnel with just enough time to say a smart one liner before a train comes crashing through imagine if m was caught short and was bit late seeing him his whole timings would ve been shot i mean how gutted would he have been pathetic storytelling that expects the audience to have an iq in single figures br br 6 the abandoned island that da silva apparently cleared of people by saying there was a chemical leak when did he do that 50 or 60 years before it must ve been at least that long as the place looked like it had been deserted for at least that amount of time br br 7 hydrogen cyanide doesn t melt your face it s not corrosive so da silva s disfigurement is there for no reason other than to try make him look like proper bond villain personally i d have just not stuck him that ridiculous wig but hey that s just me br br 8 bond s idea of taking m to scotland is fine if he plans to simply hide her away but he doesn t he plans to lure da silva to him and at no point does he consider taking some guns or some additional people with him no instead he trusts that there will still be a few old hunting rifles at his old family home and that s it no backup no weapons nothing good thinking bond br br 9 why does bond s aston martin have all the goldfinger modifications on it in this time line he won the car in casino royale so it wouldn t have any of the goldfinger mods on it plus bond himself says that the aston is not a company car meaning it s not an mi6 vehicle so it would just be a normal car br br 11 the ludicrous way that patrice who shoots bond with the depleted uranium round is apparently a ghost with no known country of origin and yet mi6 know exactly where he ll be in a couple of days and even what flight he ll be on handy huh lazy film making br br 12 the stupid plot device of m and the gamekeeper using a torch in the middle of a pitch black moor no other reason than to explain how da silva suddenly finds them br br basically it s a very weak and lazy film with more plot holes that a swiss cheese my opinion watch casino royale or even quantum of solace provided you have a sick bag handy due to the hideous shaky cam to see craig as bond as he should be avoid skyfall at all costs ',\n",

has some of the best talent assembled i m not kidding this had a great director and writer along with a dream case what the hell happened i don t fully know if it was pushed by some stupid agenda many quote producer kathleen kennedy for that reason which sadly holds weight if it was the wrong director for the job or what but this movie is just bad i felt both wounded and insulted after watching this movie the same way i felt wounded and insulted after transformers 2 revenge of the fallen after reading that you must be wondering why i am saying all of this well here we go br br first the story oh it is so scattered it does not have a focus of any real kind not to mention there are things here that just don t add up considering what was built up from the previous movie suddenly it starts with the alliance sorry the resistance still not used to that escaping the first order who has discovered them this fleet is lead by general hux who last i checked was still escaping star killer base yeah you see the first problem here there s no consistency maybe if it was a different commander it would be smoother but that was rather dumb then poe comes along and distracts hux by tooling with him as the captain says and then enters problem no 2 marvel movie style humour perhaps this sort of humour works for guardians of the galaxy and the avengers but definitely not for star wars and there s so much of it it really is forced and takes you out of the magic star wars did have humour with some hits and misses but even the misses still felt like it belonged somehow moving on poe then destroys a dreadnought s guns allowing bomber ships to launch an attack and every single one of them must have been made from tin because they just fall apart after being shot six times by enemy fighters anyway one bomber manages to succeed in destroying this dreadnought by dropping its payload there s gravity in space now while sacrificing itself the resistance escapes poe gets demoted by an angry general leia who is angry for both an understandable reason and stupid reason poe may have cost them a lot of bombers but he took out a super ship while doing it and she could have over ridden his orders at any time and oh lord there s the third problem which i ll get into when i talk about the characters meanwhile rey is on the planet which luke has exiled himself to here i wondered what luke was going to say after getting his father s lightsaber back here i wondered if he was doing some sort of special training or teaching a new jedi academy underground or both what happens after he s given the lightsaber he looks at it then tosses it over his shoulder then walks off and wants to be left alone later he talks about wanting to die so that the jedi will no longer exist which really defeats the purpose of the previous movie does it not rey must convince luke to train her and the resistance must now escape the first order who is now able to track them with a hyper drive tracking machine of some sort br br okay now let s get down to the next part the plot there isn t one or rather one that lacks consistency and focus there s something like five different stories trying to come out here there s rey trying to convince luke to train her there s the resistance trying to escape there s finn and rose new character who are on a secret mission there s kylo ren s progression and there s poe struggling with their new commander after throwing away the potential of a jedi academy or luke s secret training we get only a couple of scenes of luke training rey after too many scenes of luke being a grouch drinking alien sea cows milk right after milking them and fishing with a 100 foot spear there s this whole anti extreme capitalist message at this very boring casino where finn and rose are trying to find this hacker which kinda ends up being a red herring and i can t help but feel like there is some sort of good movie trying to get out but it s marred with so much stupidity i m sorry there s no other word for it what happens during the escape of the resistance the bridge of the capital ship gets destroyed and leia along with other officers such as admiral ackbar yeah no one s ever heard of him get sucked out into space but leia survives because right out from no where she can use the force and fly back to the bridge and get through the door while surviving in space never explained how she learned to do that by the way it would have been nice if there was a reference to luke training her but no we are just supposed to accept that she s superwoman then this new admiral comes in vice admiral holtz the only character worse than jar jar binks and she doesn t tell anyone what the plan is and only to hope for the best as they flee from the fleet which poe gets angry about and after butting heads with each other poe leads a mutiny against holtz and then tries to do something for the fleet only for leia to come back stun poe and the plan then was to escape to the nearby planet on stealth ships that cannot be scanned on any radar this whole time why holtz never told poe anything is beyond me especially considering that in real life if something like that was happening every member of the military including the privates and cadets would have been told that plan but her reason was to teach poe a lesson and she never gets called out for it meanwhile finn and rose where on that casino planet looking for a hacker they park on the beach instead of a place where it could have been better hidden i don t know why and as you expect they get imprisoned they find a hacker in their prison cell and they escape with him only to be later betrayed by him and that hacker dj i think he was called also gives the resistance the ability to scan those stealth ships the first order opens fire and holdo who remained behind on the ship just watches in horror while nearly half the fleet is destroyed until she decides to do something which is enter hyperspace at the first order fleet which leads to cool moment number two br br during the time luke and rey are training rey and kylo are able to communicate with each other with some sort of telepathy and okay i ll admit those moments weren t bad but again a few off putting moments again during that though we do learn the truth why kylo went to the dark side it s because luke after sensing his struggle with the darkness considered to murder him our once lead hero the man who against all odds managed to redeem his father who not only turned to the dark side but actually did commit many nearly successful genocides thought about killing his nephew based on visions which probably could have been avoided if he didn t activate his lightsaber also you only see him wield his green saber twice both in flashback which is very weird can you see where i m going with this after rey learns that she goes off with chewbacca who i only now just mentioned because he barely gets any screen time at all to confront kylo only to be captured brought to snoke briefly tortured by him then kylo kills snoke unexpectedly and rey and kylo fight off snokes guard kylo then talks to rey about how everything needs to die and should die so new things can begin which to be fair is an interesting idea but the execution could have been stronger oh also rey s parents are nobodies now yeah that was another red herring so far she s not kenobi s granddaughter or luke s long lost daughter no she s just this omnipotent being who can fight off sith warriors with very little

written and directed by a simple minded high school student br br the good news jarjarbinks wasn t a character in sw7 br br the bad news someone with a jarjarbinks mindset wrote and directed sw7 br br sw7 is an incoherent ripoff reboot remake mishmash of the original trilogy ot namely sw4 sw5 sw6 br br sw7 is stunning in its lack of creativity and originality the writers forgot the classic phrase is history never repeats but often rhymes it would be fine for sw7 to rhyme with the ot but instead sw7 simply repeats with minor irrelevant tweaks br br most action in sw7 is simply action for action sake not because story characters or the universe of starwars demands the action but because someone thought this action should be cool much action wasn t set up or explained and made no sense br br some infantile mind almost certainly jja wanted his deathstar to be bigger and badder than those created by george lucas so the new deathstar is 10 times larger and explodes 7 planets at a time were those 7 planets established nope were their significance established nope the new deathstar weapon is charged by sucking all the energy from the nearest sun then blasts 7 planets this sure didn t make the new deathstar more difficult to blow up sigh plus why bother once you extinguish the sun everyone on every planet in the solar system would freeze to death br br after two deathstars were blown up in the ot you d think the empire would realize investing so much time effort and resources into huge spherical space stations was a bad idea but no that would require the writers actually imagine something creative and original and dare i say fresh and new nope sw7 did exactly what a simple minded child with no creative ability would do create another deathstar only much more cumbersome and absurd br br btw why explode 7 planets simultaneously especially since the one planet that didn t get exploded the first time was the only planet that mattered made no sense whatsoever most planets in most solar systems cannot support life anyway so the whole notion is completely absurd but a simple minded child only thinks bigger and badder is better and never wonders whether their idea makes any sense cue jarjarabrams brainless child in an adult body br br an enormous percentage of the sw7 story made no sense contradicted what we know of the starwars universe or was completely unexplained and thus seemed like complete nonsense i ll mention just one of dozens of examples to illustrate br br rey is a compelling 20 ish tomboy without background grew up alone on a desert planet never knowing her parents she gets caught up in the action of the story and flies off with finn a storm trooper turned good in an old junker spaceship han solo s old spaceship amazingly minutes later after years of searching han and chewie find his ship and steal it back how convenient was that br br later rey yanks luke s lost light saber out of the snow 30 meters away with the force that she doesn t know she has and while a sith is also trying to grab it from much closer rey then handily beats the sith in a light saber fight with zero prior training or experience so much for jedi needing years of training even worse rey pulls the classic jedi mind trick on a stormtrooper to escape from the new deathstar even though she never heard of jedi mind tricks before br br anyone who knows the starwars universe has to think are you kidding me how does this girl become stronger with the force than any jedi who ever existed with no training or prior connection to the force this is beyond absurd as is the entire story br br after a day reflecting i speculated maybe rey is luke s daughter maybe luke trained her then maybe luke stranded her on a desert planet much like tatooine after erasing her memory such pure speculation could at least explain some of these absurdities but nothing in the movie provided us any insight or reason to believe her abilities made any sense whatsoever in fact it directly contradicts what we know from previous films br br incessant action and motion made locations seem small contained largely meaningless all previous starwars films especially the prequels presented the awesome grandeur and scope of the locations cities moons planets galaxy the story and action were set within except for the empty desert where rey lived sw7 did none of this even when we quickly fly into the huge hanger in the new deathstar we barely see anything no establishing shots sw7 doesn t feel set in a galaxy but a few spots on 3 planets and the deathstar and logical connections between locations are rarely established br br the story has endless holes and lapses of consistency and continuity not to mention utter absurdities like huge dog leashes attached to tie fighters inside the deathstar br br the new characters were fine and most acting was solid even excellent sometimes han however the way han solo dies is utterly absurd and totally meaningless plus he and leia had zero chemistry apparently they were long divorced plus leia ends up getting han killed the special effects were mostly competent but were totally wrong in style for starwars br br sw7 does provide setups that could lead to good sw8 and sw9 stories jarjarabrams isn t writing or directing sw8 or sw9 apparently so at least we might have a new hope for sw8 and sw9 convince george lucas to write the stories for all future star wars films ',\n",

       "  999: 'i am generally easy to please when it comes to films prior to this the worst thing i could say about a film was that it was a bit dull into the wild changed all of that i can only imagine what the real christopher was like but if this is supposed to portray him in a positive light i doubt he had many redeeming features every single thing he did made me hate him more to begin with he had a fantastic life as the summary on this website says he was a top student and athlete he had a decent sum of money for a student and a family who cared for him so what does he do he throws all of it away on a whim he gives his money away destroys everything he owns and completely abandons civilisation all without telling his family a thing this is one of the most reckless selfish idiotic inconsiderate things i have ever heard of i understand wanting to reconnect with nature i understand that people feel that society is too materialistic if you want to indulge those feelings go camping go on safari volunteer for a charity what you do not do is throw away your entire life and if you do decide to destroy everything you have ever achieved you could at least have the common courtesy to tell your parents where you are he could easily have kept in touch with his family while on his insane quest all he accomplished by keeping quiet was making his parents fear for his life fear which was perfectly justified considering the ending on his journey into the depths of stupidity he met several people who were inexplicably sympathetic to his situation they offered him every opportunity to live his life with them he had every chance to abandon his aimless wandering but he turned them all down why because he was convinced that he knew better than everybody else he ends up dying due to his own bottomless stupidity when he eats poisonous berries despite the fact that he had a guidebook which told him which berries were safe to eat any reasonable person would consult the book before eating the mystery fruits i hated everything about him throughout the film my fists were usually clenched when he died at the end of the film i imagine the audience was supposed to cry i laughed out loud for five minutes i know that makes me sound like a monster but it s the truth if a team of psychologists and writers studied me for years on end and created a character whose sole purpose was to make me angry they would not even come close to the blinding fury that i experienced watching this film as terrible as this sounds i am glad christopher mccandless is dead ',\n",

he knew the exact times everything would happen right from being captured near china being taken to the new mi6 headquarters seeing m q and bond cracking the code him being able to escape and then being also stopped by bond in exactly the right spot and at the right time to blow a hole in the underground tunnel with just enough time to say a smart one liner before a train comes crashing through imagine if m was caught short and was bit late seeing him his whole timings would ve been shot i mean how gutted would he have been pathetic storytelling that expects the audience to have an iq in single figures br br 6 the abandoned island that da silva apparently cleared of people by saying there was a chemical leak when did he do that 50 or 60 years before it must ve been at least that long as the place looked like it had been deserted for at least that amount of time br br 7 hydrogen cyanide doesn t melt your face it s not corrosive so da silva s disfigurement is there for no reason other than to try make him look like proper bond villain personally i d have just not stuck him that ridiculous wig but hey that s just me br br 8 bond s idea of taking m to scotland is fine if he plans to simply hide her away but he doesn t he plans to lure da silva to him and at no point does he consider taking some guns or some additional people with him no instead he trusts that there will still be a few old hunting rifles at his old family home and that s it no backup no weapons nothing good thinking bond br br 9 why does bond s aston martin have all the goldfinger modifications on it in this time line he won the car in casino royale so it wouldn t have any of the goldfinger mods on it plus bond himself says that the aston is not a company car meaning it s not an mi6 vehicle so it would just be a normal car br br 11 the ludicrous way that patrice who shoots bond with the depleted uranium round is apparently a ghost with no known country of origin and yet mi6 know exactly where he ll be in a couple of days and even what flight he ll be on handy huh lazy film making br br 12 the stupid plot device of m and the gamekeeper using a torch in the middle of a pitch black moor no other reason than to explain how da silva suddenly finds them br br basically it s a very weak and lazy film with more plot holes that a swiss cheese my opinion watch casino royale or even quantum of solace provided you have a sick bag handy due to the hideous shaky cam to see craig as bond as he should be avoid skyfall at all costs ',\n",

       " 740: 'i just don t know what to say this star wars movie might actually be the worst of the lot no this isn t empire strikes back of its time syndrome this i a genuinely awful movie and it has some of the best talent assembled i m not kidding this had a great director and writer along with a dream case what the hell happened i don t fully know if it was pushed by some stupid agenda many quote producer kathleen kennedy for that reason which sadly holds weight if it was the wrong director for the job or what but this movie is just bad i felt both wounded and insulted after watching this movie the same way i felt wounded and insulted after transformers 2 revenge of the fallen after reading that you must be wondering why i am saying all of this well here we go br br first the story oh it is so scattered it does not have a focus of any real kind not to mention there are things here that just don t add up considering what was built up from the previous movie suddenly it starts with the alliance sorry the resistance still not used to that escaping the first order who has discovered them this fleet is lead by general hux who last i checked was still escaping star killer base yeah you see the first problem here there s no consistency maybe if it was a different commander it would be smoother but that was rather dumb then poe comes along and distracts hux by tooling with him as the captain says and then enters problem no 2 marvel movie style humour perhaps this sort of humour works for guardians of the galaxy and the avengers but definitely not for star wars and there s so much of it it really is forced and takes you out of the magic star wars did have humour with some hits and misses but even the misses still felt like it belonged somehow moving on poe then destroys a dreadnought s guns allowing bomber ships to launch an attack and every single one of them must have been made from tin because they just fall apart after being shot six times by enemy fighters anyway one bomber manages to succeed in destroying this dreadnought by dropping its payload there s gravity in space now while sacrificing itself the resistance escapes poe gets demoted by an angry general leia who is angry for both an understandable reason and stupid reason poe may have cost them a lot of bombers but he took out a super ship while doing it and she could have over ridden his orders at any time and oh lord there s the third problem which i ll get into when i talk about the characters meanwhile rey is on the planet which luke has exiled himself to here i wondered what luke was going to say after getting his father s lightsaber back here i wondered if he was doing some sort of special training or teaching a new jedi academy underground or both what happens after he s given the lightsaber he looks at it then tosses it over his shoulder then walks off and wants to be left alone later he talks about wanting to die so that the jedi will no longer exist which really defeats the purpose of the previous movie does it not rey must convince luke to train her and the resistance must now escape the first order who is now able to track them with a hyper drive tracking machine of some sort br br okay now let s get down to the next part the plot there isn t one or rather one that lacks consistency and focus there s something like five different stories trying to come out here there s rey trying to convince luke to train her there s the resistance trying to escape there s finn and rose new character who are on a secret mission there s kylo ren s progression and there s poe struggling with their new commander after throwing away the potential of a jedi academy or luke s secret training we get only a couple of scenes of luke training rey after too many scenes of luke being a grouch drinking alien sea cows milk right after milking them and fishing with a 100 foot spear there s this whole anti extreme capitalist message at this very boring casino where finn and rose are trying to find this hacker which kinda ends up being a red herring and i can t help but feel like there is some sort of good movie trying to get out but it s marred with so much stupidity i m sorry there s no other word for it what happens during the escape of the resistance the bridge of the capital ship gets destroyed and leia along with other officers such as admiral ackbar yeah no one s ever heard of him get sucked out into space but leia survives because right out from no where she can use the force and fly back to the bridge and get through the door while surviving in space never explained how she learned to do that by the way it would have been nice if there was a reference to luke training her but no we are just supposed to accept that she s superwoman then this new admiral comes in vice admiral holtz the only character worse than jar jar binks and she doesn t tell anyone what the plan is and only to hope for the best as they flee from the fleet which poe gets angry about and after butting heads with each other poe leads a mutiny against holtz and then tries to do something for the fleet only for leia to come back stun poe and the plan then was to escape to the nearby planet on stealth ships that cannot be scanned on any radar this whole time why holtz never told poe anything is beyond me especially considering that in real life if something like that was happening every member of the military including the privates and cadets would have been told that plan but her reason was to teach poe a lesson and she never gets called out for it meanwhile finn and rose where on that casino planet looking for a hacker they park on the beach instead of a place where it could have been better hidden i don t know why and as you expect they get imprisoned they find a hacker in their prison cell and they escape with him only to be later betrayed by him and that hacker dj i think he was called also gives the resistance the ability to scan those stealth ships the first order opens fire and holdo who remained behind on the ship just watches in horror while nearly half the fleet is destroyed until she decides to do something which is enter hyperspace at the first order fleet which leads to cool moment number two br br during the time luke and rey are training rey and kylo are able to communicate with each other with some sort of telepathy and okay i ll admit those moments weren t bad but again a few off putting moments again during that though we do learn the truth why kylo went to the dark side it s because luke after sensing his struggle with the darkness considered to murder him our once lead hero the man who against all odds managed to redeem his father who not only turned to the dark side but actually did commit many nearly successful genocides thought about killing his nephew based on visions which probably could have been avoided if he didn t activate his lightsaber also you only see him wield his green saber twice both in flashback which is very weird can you see where i m going with this after rey learns that she goes off with chewbacca who i only now just mentioned because he barely gets any screen time at all to confront kylo only to be captured brought to snoke briefly tortured by him then kylo kills snoke unexpectedly and rey and kylo fight off snokes guard kylo then talks to rey about how everything needs to die and should die so new things can begin which to be fair is an interesting idea but the execution could have been stronger oh also rey s parents are nobodies now yeah that was another red herring so far she s not kenobi s granddaughter or luke s long lost daughter no she s just this omnipotent being who can fight off sith warriors with very little training and there s no explanation anyway after breaking anakin s lightsaber after a force struggle she escapes after holdo hyperspaces through the first order fleet kylo then takes the fight to the salt planet not snow planet and then there s a diet version of empire strikes back battle scene you see they have to stop the first order from using a battering ram cannon yes that s what it s called and the first order has walkers on the attack and the resistance old speers finn attempts to sacrifice himself to take out the cannon but rose rams his speeder to save him all the while dooming the rebellion finn manages to get rose all the way back to the base somehow and before the resistance moves forward luke appears talks to leia then goes to fight kylo ren on his own when luke confront kylo with anakin s blue saber which we all saw destroyed instead of his green one which he made you know the one everyone wanted to see luke sort of humiliates kylo in combat then when luke gives a speech kyloe tries to strike him down only to realize that he was a projection this whole time luke was on that planet the whole time after his ends the confrontation we go back to real luke who looks out to the twin suns of that planet then just disappears for no reason no amazing sacrifice not old age after a hard life just ran out of juice and just decided to apparently for a man who really wanted to die he didn t try very hard anyway what s left of the resistance escapes on the millennium falcon and rey and leia have a heart to heart talk then the movie cuts to a scene of these kids who were scene at the casino talk about the legend of luke skywalker then one goes outside to sweep and somehow uses the force to pull a broom to him br br can you see how little if anything here makes sense whatsoever i can go on and on but imdb has a limit let me just finish by saying just go watch the how it should have ended episode of the last jedi and there you will get a much better star wars

horrible no wonder disney super hyped the film and let nobody review in advance br br anyone who cares about story originality coherence and consistency will find sw7 horrible sw7 feels like it was written and directed by a simple minded high school student br br the good news jarjarbinks wasn t a character in sw7 br br the bad news someone with a jarjarbinks mindset wrote and directed sw7 br br sw7 is an incoherent ripoff reboot remake mishmash of the original trilogy ot namely sw4 sw5 sw6 br br sw7 is stunning in its lack of creativity and originality the writers forgot the classic phrase is history never repeats but often rhymes it would be fine for sw7 to rhyme with the ot but instead sw7 simply repeats with minor irrelevant tweaks br br most action in sw7 is simply action for action sake not because story characters or the universe of starwars demands the action but because someone thought this action should be cool much action wasn t set up or explained and made no sense br br some infantile mind almost certainly jja wanted his deathstar to be bigger and badder than those created by george lucas so the new deathstar is 10 times larger and explodes 7 planets at a time were those 7 planets established nope were their significance established nope the new deathstar weapon is charged by sucking all the energy from the nearest sun then blasts 7 planets this sure didn t make the new deathstar more difficult to blow up sigh plus why bother once you extinguish the sun everyone on every planet in the solar system would freeze to death br br after two deathstars were blown up in the ot you d think the empire would realize investing so much time effort and resources into huge spherical space stations was a bad idea but no that would require the writers actually imagine something creative and original and dare i say fresh and new nope sw7 did exactly what a simple minded child with no creative ability would do create another deathstar only much more cumbersome and absurd br br btw why explode 7 planets simultaneously especially since the one planet that didn t get exploded the first time was the only planet that mattered made no sense whatsoever most planets in most solar systems cannot support life anyway so the whole notion is completely absurd but a simple minded child only thinks bigger and badder is better and never wonders whether their idea makes any sense cue jarjarabrams brainless child in an adult body br br an enormous percentage of the sw7 story made no sense contradicted what we know of the starwars universe or was completely unexplained and thus seemed like complete nonsense i ll mention just one of dozens of examples to illustrate br br rey is a compelling 20 ish tomboy without background grew up alone on a desert planet never knowing her parents she gets caught up in the action of the story and flies off with finn a storm trooper turned good in an old junker spaceship han solo s old spaceship amazingly minutes later after years of searching han and chewie find his ship and steal it back how convenient was that br br later rey yanks luke s lost light saber out of the snow 30 meters away with the force that she doesn t know she has and while a sith is also trying to grab it from much closer rey then handily beats the sith in a light saber fight with zero prior training or experience so much for jedi needing years of training even worse rey pulls the classic jedi mind trick on a stormtrooper to escape from the new deathstar even though she never heard of jedi mind tricks before br br anyone who knows the starwars universe has to think are you kidding me how does this girl become stronger with the force than any jedi who ever existed with no training or prior connection to the force this is beyond absurd as is the entire story br br after a day reflecting i speculated maybe rey is luke s daughter maybe luke trained her then maybe luke stranded her on a desert planet much like tatooine after erasing her memory such pure speculation could at least explain some of these absurdities but nothing in the movie provided us any insight or reason to believe her abilities made any sense whatsoever in fact it directly contradicts what we know from previous films br br incessant action and motion made locations seem small contained largely meaningless all previous starwars films especially the prequels presented the awesome grandeur and scope of the locations cities moons planets galaxy the story and action were set within except for the empty desert where rey lived sw7 did none of this even when we quickly fly into the huge hanger in the new deathstar we barely see anything no establishing shots sw7 doesn t feel set in a galaxy but a few spots on 3 planets and the deathstar and logical connections between locations are rarely established br br the story has endless holes and lapses of consistency and continuity not to mention utter absurdities like huge dog leashes attached to tie fighters inside the deathstar br br the new characters were fine and most acting was solid even excellent sometimes han however the way han solo dies is utterly absurd and totally meaningless plus he and leia had zero chemistry apparently they were long divorced plus leia ends up getting han killed the special effects were mostly competent but were totally wrong in style for starwars br br sw7 does provide setups that could lead to good sw8 and sw9 stories jarjarabrams isn t writing or directing sw8 or sw9 apparently so at least we might have a new hope for sw8 and sw9 convince george lucas to write the stories for all future star wars films ',\n",
